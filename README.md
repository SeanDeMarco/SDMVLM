This Git repository presents a Jupyter Notebook containing a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) implementation created as part of a Bachelor's Thesis at L-Universit√† ta' Malta (UM).

The Notebook contains three sections as follows:
    Functions section - This section contains all the functions used in the program and all Python library imports required. The functions are organised in the order through which the program runs them.
    User Input Section - This section is where the user is required to input the wing parameters and free stream conditions.
    Output Section - This section provides a 3D visualisation of the wing developed and lastly, presents the Cl and Cd results of the wing.

The VLM program is capable of running an analysis on any wing planform containing the following properties:
    Sweep
    Taper
    Dihedral
    Geometric washout
    Symmetry
    NACA 4 digit airfoil
    Winglets

The program also has a boundary condition which allows the simulation of the disruptive effect of having a closed wing eg: fuselage's disruptive effect on the wing
